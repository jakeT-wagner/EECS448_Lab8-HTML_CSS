        Uncle Iroh, beloved character in the hit television show Avatar the Last Airbender, 
        wowed fans multifold with his wisdom, comedic relief, and firebending prowess. 
        Iroh was a lot of things to many people in the Avatar universe, notably as a general for 
        the Fire Nation, member of the White Lotus, and friend to all. Iroh was also an uncle to 
        Zuko, molding him into his own man. He also befriended the Gaang, and provided them wisom 
        many times over the course of the show. During the end of the 100 Year War, he, alongside 
        other White Lotus members, re-captured Ba Sing Se from the Fire Nation, helping to bring 
        balance back to the World. Upon his death, Iroh joined the Spirit World, a place not many 
        humans venture. They say that you can still meet Iroh there, where he dishes out wisdom to 
        all.</p>
